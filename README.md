# Inspiration:
- In today's digital age, financial fraud is a growing threat that affects all generations. However, our focus is particularly on protecting the younger generation. Unlike the elderly, who are often targeted by more traditional scams, our generation faces unique challenges. For instance, our friends' accounts can get hacked without our knowledge, making us vulnerable to scams from seemingly trusted sources. This trust in our social connections can be exploited by fraudsters, leading to significant financial loss and personal distress. Therefore, it is crucial to address these specific vulnerabilities and provide tailored solutions to safeguard our generation from the evolving landscape of financial fraud.
